# microbit accelerometer
Tasks for learning physical computing with the microbit
##### -an istrument that measures the accelration of the microbit
##### -Determines the movement of the North,East,South,West 
## What we have done today
#### -microbits can measure the speed using the built in accelrometer
#### -we also created the microbit so that when it free falled it would come up with an image
#### -we also looked at how a microbit can be used as a compass, making the microbit show an arrow either North,East,South,West
